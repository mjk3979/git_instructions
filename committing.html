<h1>Committing your changes</h1>

<h2>An overview of the Git repository</h2>
<p>A Git repository consists of a working directory
	(the folder itself and its contained regular files,
	which can be modified using regular programs);
	a staging area (also called the index) where you collect changes in preparation for creating a commit;
	and a tree of commits, each of which represents a set of related changes to the project.
	In order to commit a set of changes, you must first add them to the index and then perform a commit.</p>

<h2>Querying status</h2>
<!-- This section addresses the status command. -->
<p>When using Git, if you are ever unsure of the state of
	your working directory relative to the master branch,
	the <code>status</code> command can be extremely informative.</p>
<p>For example, at this point in the project, nothing has been done.
	Let's do a small experiment to demonstrate the usefulness of the <code>status</code> command!</p>
<ol>
	<li>To create a file for our commit (in this case,
		the generic file <code>file1.txt</code>), run:
		<br/><code>$ touch file1.txt</code></li>
	<li>To ensure the file was successfully created, run:
		<br/><code>$ ls</code>
		<br/>You should find <code>file1.txt</code> in the list of files.</li>
	<li>Now that we have a file for our first commit,
		let's first check the status of our repo:
		<br/><code>$ git status</code> </li>
	<li>This should yield the following output:
		<br/><code># On branch master</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Initial commit</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Untracked files:</code>
		<br/><code># 	(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># 		file1.txt</code>
		<br/><code>nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</code>
	</li>
	<li>Notice the <code>Untracked files</code> header: it indicates that <code>file1.txt</code>'s history is not being tracked in our repository.
	In order for such files to be included in our next commit, we will have to learn how to stage/track files.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tracking files</h2>
<!--This section discusses adding new files to the index. -->
<p>Before we can make any commits,
	we need to tell Git which files we want to include.
	To do this, for each file that we want to be version-controlled,
	we must <code>add</code> it to the holding area for ready-to-commit files
	(aka the "index" or staging area).</p>
<ol>
	<li>We want to commit our new file called <code>file1.txt</code>,
		so let's add it to the commit!
		You can do this with the following command:
		<br/><code>$ git add file1.txt</code>
	</li>
	<li>To check if it worked, we will use the <code>status</code> tool again:
		<br/><code>$ git status</code>
	</li>
	<li>This time, the output generated is different:
		<br/><code># On branch master</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Initial commit</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Changes to be committed:</code>
		<br/><code># 	(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># 		new file: file1.txt</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
	</li>
	<li>Note that Git now sees our "newly-added" file.
	</li>
	<li>But wait!
		I actually want to change the contents of <code>file1.txt</code>,
		but I already added it to the commit!
		We can fix this issue after we make the desired changes to the file,
		simply by "updating" the version of the file that has already been added to the commit.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Updating files</h2>
<!-- This section discusses re-adding modified files prior to making a commit -->
<p>When working with version-controlled files,
	it is common to suddenly remember something you wanted to do to a file before committing it, but you already added it to the commit!
	Worry not; this is a very easy fix.</p>
<p>We want to make a slight change to <code>file1.txt</code>
	and then make a commit with the most up-to-date version.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open <code>file1.txt</code> in your favorite text editor,
		and add some text of your choice.
		Save the file and return to the terminal window.</li>
	<li>Now what? The <code>status</code> command can give us a hint:
		<br/><code>$ git status</code></li>
	<li>Now we see that there are two different versions
		of <code>file1.txt</code> that have not been committed:
		the version in the stage (unchanged) and the one in our current working directory (changed).
		<br/><code># On branch master</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Initial commit</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Changes to be committed:</code>
		<br/><code># 	(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># 		new file: file1.txt</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Changes not staged for commit:</code>
		<br/><code># 	(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)</code>
		<br/><code># 	(use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># 		modified: file1.txt</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
	</li>
	<li>We must decide how we want to proceed from these two options:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Update the version in the stage to reflect the changes:
				<ul>
					<li>Re-add the file to the stage, including the changes:
						<br/><code>$ git add file1.txt</code></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Discard the changes and keep the previous version for your commit:
				<ul>
					<li>Discard the changes made to <code>file1.txt</code> after it was added to the stage:
						<br/><code>$ git checkout -- file1.txt</code></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Just to double check that everything is as it should be:
		<br/><code>$ git status</code></li>
	<li>Observe the following output:
		<br/><code># On branch master</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Initial commit</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># Changes to be committed:</code>
		<br/><code># 	(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
		<br/><code># 		new file: file1.txt</code>
		<br/><code># </code>
	</li>
	<li>Now we're ready to make our first commit!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Making commits</h2>
<!-- This section discusses making commits -->
<p></p>
<ol>
	<li>We have already made sure that the stage accurately represents
		everyting that we want to include in our commit,
		so we are ready to go.
	</li>
	<li>To make the commit, use the following command:
		<br/><code>$ git commit</code></li>
	<li>If you are working in the terminal, you will automatically
		be taken to your default text editor.
		Enter the commit message "<code>init commit</code>",
		save the file, and exit.
	</li>
	<li>The output produced will look something like this
		(possibly with a few small deviations):
		<br/><code>[master (root-commit) 949b9f1] init commit</code>
		<br/><code> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code>
		<br/><code> create mode 100644 file1.txt</code></li>
	<li>For the sake of knowledge, let's check our <code>status</code> again,
		now that the commit is complete:
		<br/><code>$ git status</code></li>
	<li>Observe the following output:
		<br/><code># On branch master</code>
		<br/><code>nothing to commit (working directory clean) </code></li>
	<li>Success!</li>
	<li><u>Note:</u> This is usually the best time
		to collect and submit your work for grading.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Viewing your commit history</h2>
<!-- This section discusses the use of git log -->
<p>If at any point in the progression of your project,
	you want to take a look at a history of all of your commits so far,
	Git has the perfect tool for you!</p>
<ul>
	<li>To briefly list all past commits
		(including corresponding commit messages)
		right there in the terminal window:
		<ol>
			<li>Issue the following command and enjoy:
				<br/><code>$ git log --oneline</code></li>
			<li>For example, after the above commit,
				the following log would be displayed:
				<br/><code>949b9f1 init commit</code></li>
			<li>If your log output is longer than the terminal window,
				you will need to press the "q" key to return to the command line.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If your professor wants proof that you used version control
		(and allows the use of Git),
		you can pipe the verbose commit log into a file to optionally include in the submission of your work for grading.
		<ol>
			<li>For example, to save your commit history in a file
				called <code>log_file.txt</code>, use the following command:
				<br/><code>$ git log > log_file.txt</code></li>
			<li>If you open this file in your preferred text editor,
				you'll see that all past commits
				(including corresponding commit messages)
				are now documented.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
		
</ul>
