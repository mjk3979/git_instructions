<h1>Committing your changes</h1>

<h2>An overview of the Git repository</h2>
<p>A Git repository consists of a working directory (the folder itself and its contained regular files, which can be modified using regular programs); a staging area (also called the index) where you collect changes in preparation for creating a commit; and a tree of commits, each of which represents a set of related changes to the project.  In order to commit a set of changes, you must first add them to the index and then perform a commit.</p>

<h2>Querying status</h2>
<!--TODO: This section should address the status command-->
<p>When using Git, if you are ever unsure of the state of your working directory relative to the master branch, the <code>status</code> command can be extremely informative.</p>
<p>For example, at this point in the project, nothing has been done.  Let's do a small experiment to demonstrate the usefulness of the <code>status</code> command!</p>
<ol>
<li>To create a file for our commit (in this case, the generic file <code>file1.java</code>), run:
	<br/><code>$ touch file1.java</code></li>
<li>To ensure the file was successfully created, run:
	<br/><code>$ ls</code>
	<br/>You should find <code>file1.java</code> in the list of files.</li>
<li>Now that we have a file for our first commit, let's first check the status of our repo:
	<br/><code>$ git status</code> </li>
<li>This should yield the following output:
	<br/><code>$ (TODO: OUTPUT)</code> </li>
<li>This means that .... (TODO: EXPLANATION).<code></code> </li>
<li>In order to fix this issue, we will have to learn how to stage/track files.</li>
</ol>
