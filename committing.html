<h1>Committing your changes</h1>

<h2>An overview of the Git repository</h2>
<p>A Git repository consists of a working directory (the folder itself and its contained regular files, which can be modified using regular programs); a staging area (also called the index) where you collect changes in preparation for creating a commit; and a tree of commits, each of which represents a set of related changes to the project.  In order to commit a set of changes, you must first add them to the index and then perform a commit.</p>

<h2>Querying status</h2>
<!--TODO: This section should address the status command-->

<h2>Tracking files</h2>
<!--TODO: This section will discuss adding new files to the index-->

<h2>Updating files</h2>
<!--TODO: This section will discuss re-adding modified files-->

<h2>Making commits</h2>

<h2>Viewing diffs</h2>
<!--TODO: All sorts of diffs should go here-->
