<h2>Setting up Eclipse</h2>
    
<p>
If you have used Eclipse before, you may skip the installation.
If you have not built and run a <b>Java program</b> under Eclipse,
you should do the section on &quot;Using Eclipse for Java&quot;. 
Then you may proceed to configure Git, learn how to use 
Git as a  version controlling system with Eclipse and start the programming assignments.

<h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>
    
Before installing, watch the 
<a href="Media/eclipse.mov" target="_blank">instructional video</a>
on setting up your environment.  <b>The video describes installing a
previous version of Eclipse. Some aspects of the installation may be
different than depicted in the video.</b>
Note that the video refers to the machine named <code>holly.cs.rit.edu</code> 
which no longer exists; instead you can use other department Linux machines 
such as <code>glados.cs.rit.edu</code>.
What follows are the details of the 
installation and initial configuration. 
Note: To avoid congestion, you may want to use one of the lab Linux
machines instead of <code>glados.cs.rit.edu</code>. There are over 
40 lab machines available - all of them can be used remotely.
(This document will use the machine <code>glados.cs.rit.edu</code>.)<br><br>

<p>
If you are installing Eclipse on <b>your own machine</b>, download and 
install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse Standard</a>.
<p>
After the installation, you will have a workspace directory on your machine. 
The workspace directory will hold all of your Eclipse software development 
project files during development.
<p>

<h3>Using Eclipse for Java</h3>
If you have been using Eclipse for another language, such as Python,
switch to the Java perspective. 
<p>
Select <tt>Window -> Open Perspective -> Java</tt>.
<p>Note that you can always see what perspective you are currently in
by looking in the upper-right part of the Eclipse window.
<h4>Create a <tt>Hello</tt> project</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Launch Eclipse and create a new 
      Java project, <tt>File -> New -> Java Project</tt> and enter the 
      following information:
      <pre> Project Name: <font color="darkgreen">Hello</font> </pre>
    
  <li> Create a <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt> program.  In the 
      <tt>Package Explorer</tt> pane right-click on the <tt>Hello</tt> 
      folder and select <tt>New -> Class</tt>.  Enter the following 
      information and then click <tt>Finish</tt>.
      <pre>
        Enter <font color="darkgreen">HelloWorld</font> next to "Name:"
        Check the box next to "public static void main(String[] args):"
        Check the box next to "Generate comments:"
      </pre>
  <li> Modify the resulting <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt> file in the Eclipse
      editor to make it look like 
      <a href="Supplied/HelloWorld.java" target="_blank">this file</a>.
</ol>
<h4>Run the program</h4>
<ol>
  <li> In <tt>Package Explorer</tt> pane, right-click 
      on <tt>Hello.java</tt> and select <tt>Run As -> Java Application</tt>.
  <li> Verify the output in the <tt>Console</tt> window.
</ol>
   
<h3>Configuring Git</h3>
    
<center><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=150 SRC="Media/Git.png"></center>
<p>
Part of this assignment is to begin your education in UNIX.
You will begin to use the terminal command line because several
software development operations may require you 
to know how to use the command line.
<p>
You may find some of the following UNIX Documentation links useful:
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="References/unixRefCard.html" target="_blank">UNIX Reference Card</a>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~f2y-grd/beg-guide.pdf " target="_blank">
CS Dept. Introduction to UNIX PDF</a>
  <li>
<a href=" http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/ " target="_blank">
Michael Stonebank's 2001 UNIX tutorial</a> is useful and widely available.
http://biocomp.health.unm.edu/biomed505/Unix/Unix2/
  <li>
<a href=" http://winscp.net/ " target="_blank">
WinSCP, Secure copy file transfer program for MSWindows</a>
  <li> Search the internet for &quot;xming&quot; if you are a PC user.  
      The xming facility adds XWindows capabilities to your PC.  XWindows 
      is the X11 windows server and toolkit developed over many years at 
      <b>MIT</b>, and it allows you to run a <tt>GUI</tt> program remotely.
</ul>

<ol>
  <li> Log in to a CS system.  
      <p>If you are in a lab and sitting in front of a Linux machine or 
         a Mac, just open a terminal.
      <p> If you are using your own Linux or Mac machine, the <tt>ssh</tt>
         program is a secure, remote login shell program. Open a terminal
         and in the shell type the following,
         where <tt>{username}</tt> is your CS username:
         <pre>
         $ <font color="darkgreen">ssh -Y {username}@glados.cs.rit.edu</font>
         </pre>  
      <p> On Windows machines, install (only if using your own machine) and 
         then run <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">PuTTY</a>.
         Under the <tt>Session</tt> category enter the following and click
     <tt>Open</tt>.
         <pre>
           <font color="darkgreen">Host Name: glados.cs.rit.edu</font>
         </pre>
  <li> Enter the command sequence shown below.  In the illustration, the $ 
      is the prompt and the hash mark begins a comment extending to the end 
      of the line; do not enter these parts.  The <tt>git</tt> and 
      <tt>pico</tt> commands are the CVS program and the pico editing 
      program respectively.
      <pre>
        $ <font color="darkgreen">cd</font>                        # go to home dir.
        $ <font color="darkgreen">mkdir rit_git</font>             # create git repository directory
        $ <font color="darkgreen">git init --bare rit_git</font>   # initialize git repository
        $ <font color="darkgreen">mkdir -p .ssh</font>             # create .ssh dir. if non-existent
        $ <font color="darkgreen">pico .ssh/environment</font>     # edit environment file in .ssh dir.
         <font color="darkgreen">PATH=/opt/csw/bin:/usr/bin</font> # add line to file. Ctrl-X + Y to save
        $ <font color="darkgreen">pwd</font>                       <b><font color="darkred"># record full path for next step</font></b>
      </pre>
  <li> Go to Eclipse and connect to your Git repository.  Select 
      <tt>Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> Git</tt>.
      Click the drop-down arrow in the top right corner of the <tt>Git Repositories</tt> pane and select 
      <tt>Clone a Repository</tt>.  Enter the following information 
      and click <tt>Finish</tt>. When prompted, enter your CS password. 
      <p>
      Note: <tt>{path_from_pwd}</tt> is the string returned by the 
      <tt>pwd</tt> command, and <tt>{username}</tt> and <tt>{password}</tt> 
      are your CS credentials.
      <p>
      Note: If asked about creating a <tt>.ssh/known_hosts</tt> file,
      agree to it.
      <pre> 
        Host: <font color="darkgreen">glados.cs.rit.edu</font>
        Repository Path: <font color="darkgreen">{path_from_pwd}/rit_git</font>
        User: <font color="darkgreen">{username}</font>
        Password: <font color="darkgreen">{password}</font>
        Connection type: <font color="darkgreen">ssh</font>
        <font color="darkgreen">select checkbox for</font> "Store in Secure Store"

<h3>Committing A Project to Git Repository</h3>
        
<!--  hidden todo ============================================
    <center><IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=300 SRC="Media/commit.jpg"></center>
  ============================================ hidden todo -->
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Change back to the Eclipse Java perspective by doing: 
      <p> Select <tt>Window -> Open Perspective -> Java</tt>.
  <li> In the <tt>Package Explorer</tt> pane, right-click on the 
      <tt>Hello</tt> project folder and select 
      <tt>Team -> Share Project</tt>.
  <li>Select Git and click <tt>Next</tt>. 
  <li> Select the repository you just created and click <tt>Finish</tt>.
  <li> Right click on the project you just shared and select <tt>Team -> Commit</tt>.
  <li> Enter a comment for the commit operation (i.e. 
      <tt>Initial revision.</tt>), select the files you wish
       to include, and click <tt>Commit</tt>.
  <li> Right click on the project again and select <tt>Team -> Push Branch</tt>.
  <li> Add an additional print statement in <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt> 
      and make a second commit of the file.
  <li> This time, after selecting the files to commit, click <tt>Commit and Push</tt>.
       From now on, whenever you want to send your changes to the remote repository, you
       will want to use this button instead of the <tt>Commit</tt> button.
  <li> On the file system, navigate to the <b>rit_git</b> folder 
      where your program file resides and verify that the file is 
      present and correct. This folder is where Eclipse
      keeps its working copy of the version-controlled content. When
      you commit through Eclipse, the commit uses this as the source
      for a new version stored in the project's reposity folder under
      $HOME/rit_git/.
</ol>

 <b>Note: You should never attempt to add, modify or delete any files 
    in the repository $HOME/rit_git/ because the git program may detect it
    as corruption and refuse to fetch of recover your files!
 </b>

<h3>Checking Out a Project from a Git Repository</h3>
<p>
The advantage of using a source code repository is that you can work on
code on different machines while keeping everything synchronized.  Each 
time you complete a coding session, commit and push your changes to the repository. 
<p>
If you go to a different machine you will either check out the project 
(first time) or pull changes from the repository.  For example, you can start work on a lab 
using a CS machine, commit and push your changes, and then go home and check out the 
project on your own machine to continue work there - even if you use a 
different operating system!
<p>
<ul>
  <li> To check out a project for the first time in Eclipse, select 
      <tt>Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> Git</tt>.
      In the <tt>Git Repositories</tt> pane turn the arrow for the 
      repository icon and the <tt>Working Directory</tt> down.  This will reveal all 
      of your projects in the repository.  Right-click on the project 
      you want and select <tt>Import Projects</tt>.</li> 
      <p> ... OR ... 
  <li> To update a project within Eclipse that is already checked out 
      from Git, right-click on the project folder in the 
      <tt>Package Explorer</tt> perspective and select 
      <tt>Team -> Pull</tt>.</li>
</ul>

      <h3>Account Registration for <tt>try</tt> (pre-project work)</h3>

    <p>
      This course will be using the <i><tt>try</tt></i> program for
      project submissions.  Before you can submit any work
      through <i><tt>try</tt></i> you will first need to register, so
      that <i><tt>try</tt></i> knows what section you are in (this
      makes sure that the work you submit is placed in the correct
      location for grading).  Since you are already logged in to a 
      Linux-based CS machine, now is a good time to do this!
    <p>
      From the unix prompt, type:
      <ul>
        <tt><font color="darkgreen">try grd-142 register /dev/null</font></tt>
      </ul>
      You will then be prompted to select a lecture section.  After
      that the registration process will display the information that
      was recorded for you.  Note that it will display a
      <tt><font color="darkgreen">Lab section: ##</font></tt>,
      (where <tt><font color="darkgreen">##</font></tt> is a default
      value based on your lecture section number); don't worry about
      this as we generally won't be using <i><tt>try</tt></i> with the
      labs.
    <p>
      For more information about the <i><tt>try</tt></i> program, you can find
      documentation at:
      <ul>
        <A HREF="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~vcss243/Misc/try.html"> 
      Guide to the <b>try</b> submission tool</a>
      </ul>
      You may want to verify with your SLI that you have correctly
      registered before leaving the lab.
