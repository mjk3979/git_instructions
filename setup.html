<h1>Setting up a repository</h1>

<h2>Setting your name and email</h2>
<p>Before using Git on any system for the first time, it is a good idea to set your name and email address, since Git will include this information in each commit message you author.  Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set your name by using this command:
	<br/><code>$ git config --global user.name "&lt;Your Name&gt;"</code></li>
<li>Set your email as follows:
	<br/><code>$ git config --global user.email &lt;your_email_address&gt;</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>If you plan to develop on the CS systems</h2>
<p>If you intend to write your code on the department's systems (e.g. while connected via SSH), all you need to do is initialize a standard Git repository.  To do this, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you've set your name and email, as detailed in the above section.  To check, look for this information in the output of the command:
	<br/><code>$ git config --global -l</code></li>
<li>Move into the folder where you keep your work for the course, for example by running the command:
	<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code></li>
<li>Create a repository in a new folder of your choice.  For instance, to create one called <code>Lab1</code>, run:
	<br/><code>$ git init Lab1</code></li>
<li>To check that your repository was successfully created, use the following command to list the contents of the current directory:
	<br/><code>$ ls -a</code>
	<br/>and look for the hidden <code>.git</code> folder.  This folder identifies the directory as a Git repository.</li>
</ol>

<h2>If you plan to develop on your own machine</h2>
<p>If you intend to write your code on your own system, create an upstream on the CS systems and clone it to a standard Git repository on your own machine.  This is done as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working on a CS department system, move into the folder where you keep your work for the course, for example by running the command:
	<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code></li>
<li>Create a bare repository in a new folder of your choice.  For instance, to create one called <code>Lab1.git</code>, run:
	<br/><code>$ git init --bare Lab1.git</code></li>
<li>On your own system, download Git from the project website at <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> and install the package</li>
<li>If you're on a Windows system, locate and launch the newly-installed application called <code>Git Bash</code>; otherwise, simply open a terminal (e.g. on Mac OS X, click the magnifying glass in the top right corner of the screen and type "Terminal").</li>
<li>In the terminal on your own system, move into the directory where you keep your coursework, for example:
	<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code></li>
<li>Clone the repository you created earlier on the CS systems.  To do this for an upstream you called Lab1.git, run:
	<br/><code>$ git clone <your-username>@glados.cs.rit.edu:Courses/CS/CS1/Labs/Lab1</code></li>
<li>To check that your repository was successfully created, use the following command to list the contents of the current directory:
	<br/><code>$ ls -a</code>
	<br/>and look for the hidden <code>.git</code> folder.  This folder identifies the directory as a Git repository.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Regarding code hosting services and public repositories</h2>
<p>There are many online services that offer Git repository hosting, the most popular being GitHub and BitBucket.
The CS department recommends that you store your code on department systems.
If, however, you decide to use a third-party service, carefully ensure that your hosted repositories are private.
If you publish course code to a public repository, you can be penalized for cheating pursuant to <a href="http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/sectionD/D8.html" target="_blank">RIT's Academic Integrity Policy</a> and the <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/pub/doc/DCS.honesty.final.html" target="_blank">department Policy on Academic Honesty</a>.</p>
