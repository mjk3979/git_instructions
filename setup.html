<h1>Setting up a repository</h1>

<h2>If you plan to develop on the CS systems</h2>
<p>If you intend to write your code on the department's systems (e.g. while connected via SSH), all you need to do is initialize a standard Git repository.  To do this, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Move into the folder where you keep your work for the course, for example by running the command:<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code></li>
<li>Create a repository in a new folder of your choice.  For instance, to create one called <code>Lab1</code>, run:<br/><code>$ git init Lab1</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>If you plan to develop on your own machine</h2>
<p>If you intend to write your code on your own system, create an upstream on the CS systems and clone it to a standard Git repository on your own machine.  This is done as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working on a CS department system, move into the folder where you keep your work for the course, for example by running the command:<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code></li>
<li>Create a bare repository in a new folder of your choice.  For instance, to create one called <code>Lab1.git</code>, run:<br/><code>$ git init --bare Lab1.git</code></li>
<li>On your own system, download Git from the project website at <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> and install the package</li>
<li>If you're on a Windows system, locate and launch the newly-installed application called <code>Git Bash</code>; otherwise, simply open a terminal (e.g. on Mac OS X, click the magnifying glass in the top right corner of the screen and type Terminal).</li>
<li>In the terminal on your own system, move into the directory where you keep your coursework, for example:<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code></li>
<li>Clone the repository you created earlier on the CS systems.  To do this for an upstream you called Lab1.git, run:<br/><code>$ git clone <your-username>@glados.cs.rit.edu:Courses/CS/CS1/Labs/Lab1</code></li>
</ol>
