<h1>Setting up a repository</h1>

<h2>Configuring your name and email</h2>
<p>Before using Git on any system for the first time,
	it is a good idea to set your name and email address,
	since Git will include this information in each commit message you author.
	Follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Set your name by using this command:
		<br/><code>$ git config --global user.name "&lt;Your Name&gt;"</code>
	</li>
	<li>Set your email as follows:
		<br/><code>$ git config --global user.email &lt;your_email_address&gt;</code>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>If you plan to develop on the CS systems</h2>
<p>If you intend to write your code on the department's systems
	(e.g. while connected via SSH),
	all you need to do is initialize a standard Git repository.
	To do this, follow these steps.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure you've set your name and email,
		as detailed in the above section.
		To check, look for this information in the output of the command:
		<br/><code>$ git config --global -l</code>
	</li>
	<li>Move into the folder where you keep your work for the course,
		for example by running the command:
		<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code>
	</li>
	<li>Create a repository in a new folder of your choice.
		For instance, to create one called <code>Lab1</code>, run:
		<br/><code>$ git init Lab1</code>
	</li>
	<li>This should result in a message being printed in the terminal, eg:
		<br/><code>Initialized empty Git repository in ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs/Lab1/.git/</code>
		<br/>(Note: the exact path may differ based on your exact setup!!)
	</li>
	<li>On the offchance that this message was not printed,
		there is another way to check whether your repository was successfully created.
		To do this, navigate into the new directory and list its contents with the following series of commands:
		<br/><code>$ cd Lab1</code>
		<br/><code>$ ls -a</code>
		<br/>Now look for the hidden <code>.git</code> folder.
		This folder identifies the directory as a Git repository.
		If you see it, you know the <code>init</code> was successful!
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>If you plan to develop on your own machine</h2>
<p>If you intend to write your code on your own system,
	you have to create an upstream on the CS systems
	and clone it to a standard Git repository on your own machine.
	This is done as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Working on a CS department system,
		move into the folder where you keep your work for the course,
		for example by running the command:
		<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code>
	</li>
	<li>Create a bare repository in a new folder of your choice
		(or use a repository that you have already created).
		To create a bare repo called <code>Lab1.git</code>, run:
		<br/><code>$ git init --bare Lab1.git</code>
	</li>
	<li>This should result in a message being printed in the terminal, eg:
		<br/><code>Initialized empty Git repository in ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs/Lab1.git/</code>
		<br/>(Note: the exact path may differ based on your exact setup!!)
	</li>
	<li>On your own system, download Git from the 
		<a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">project website</a> and install the package.
	</li>
	<li>If you're on a Windows system, locate and launch the newly-installed
		"Git Bash" application;
		otherwise, simply open a terminal (e.g. on Mac OS X, click the magnifying glass in the top right corner of the screen and type "Terminal").
	</li>
	<li>In the terminal on your own system,
		move into the directory where you keep your coursework, for example:
		<br/><code>$ cd ~/Courses/CS/CS1/Labs</code>
	</li>
	<li>Clone the repository you created earlier on the CS systems.
		To do this for an upstream you called Lab1.git,
		run the following command and then enter your CS password:
		<br/><code>$ git clone {your-username}@glados.cs.rit.edu:Courses/CS/CS1/Labs/Lab1</code>
	</li>
	<li>This should result in a message being printed in the terminal, eg:
		<br/><code>Cloning into 'Lab1'...</code>
	</li>
	<li>On the offchance that this message was not printed,
		there is another way to check whether your repository was successfully created.
		To do this, navigate into the new directory and list its contents with the following series of commands:
		<br/><code>$ cd Lab1</code>
		<br/><code>$ ls -a</code>
	</li>
	<li>Now look for the hidden <code>.git</code> folder.
		This folder identifies the directory as a Git repository.
		If you see it, that means the <code>clone</code> was successful!
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Regarding code hosting services and public repositories</h2>
<p>There are many online services that offer Git repository hosting,
	the most popular being GitHub and BitBucket.
	For the sake of simplicity,
	the CS department recommends that you store your code on department systems and access it remotely as-needed.
	If, however, you decide to use a third-party service,
	carefully ensure that your hosted repositories are <i>private</i>!
	If you publish course code to a public repository,
	you can be penalized for cheating pursuant to
	<a href="http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/sectionD/D8.html" target="_blank">RIT's Academic Integrity Policy</a>
	and the <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/pub/doc/DCS.honesty.final.html" target="_blank">department Policy on Academic Honesty</a>.
