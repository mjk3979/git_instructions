<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>"I have made a grave error.  How do I reset everything??"</h2>
<p>There are two possible courses of action, depending on your needs:
	<ul>
		<li>If you want to keep the changes you've made
			since you're last commit, you can unstage everything:
			<pre>$ git reset</pre></li>
		<li>If you want to discard your changes and start fresh,
			simply revert everything to the last commit:
			<pre>$ git reset --hard</pre></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>"When I commit, Git drops me to a scary editor with no on-screen help!
	How do I get out?"</h2>
<p>It's likely that your default text editor is set to some sort of
	<code>vi</code> implementation.  To do your thing and get out,
	follow these steps:
	<ol>
		<li>Press the <code>"i"</code> key.</li>
		<li>Type your commit message.</li>
		<li>Press the <code>esc</code> key.</li>
		<li>Type "<code>:wq</code>" and press <code>enter</code>.</li>
		<li>Tada!</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>If you want Git to default to a more user-friendly editor, configure it to use your favorite.
	For example:
		<pre>$ git config --global core.editor nano</pre>
		Or, if you want something more graphical:
		<pre>$ git config --global core.editor gedit</pre>
</p>

<h2>"I tried to commit, but I got <code>Aborting commit
	due to empty commit message</code>.  Huh?"</h2>
<p>When Git expected you to provide some sort of commit message,
	ie: "Init commit", you probably made one of the following errors:
	<ul>
		<li>failed to enter anything</li>
		<li>quit the text editor without saving</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The index and working directory have been left intact,
	but you will have to repeat the <code>commit</code> operation.
	This time, be sure to enter a commit message and save before quiting.
</p>

<h2>"When I commit, Git complains <code>nothing to commit
	(working directory clean)</code>.  What did I do wrong?"</h2>
<p>This error indicates that none of the tracked files have been modified.
	Make sure you've saved all of the files you've changed and called
	<code>git add</code> on all of the files you want to include in the commit.
