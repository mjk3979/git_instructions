<h1>Introduction to Git</h1>

<h2>What is version control?</h2>
<p>Version control is used to keep track of the changes made
	on a set of files over time (commonly known as "revisions" or "commits").
	This is useful for recovering from accidentally deleted or broken code
	and for collaborative coding in a team.
	Git is a popular modern version control system that is used
	by many free and open source software projects,
	as well as numerous tech. companies.
</p>

<h2>An overview of the Git repository</h2>
<p>Each Git repository consists of a <code>.git</code> folder
	and the working directory.
	The <code>.git</code> folder contains a representation of
	the version history and is usually located inside the working directory.
	The working directory contains the currently "checked-out" commit; a staging area (also called the "index") where you collect changes in preparation for creating a commit; and a tree of commits, each of which represents a set of related changes to the project.
</p>
<p>Each "change" (or commit) consists of a user-entered message
	describing the changes that were made,
	a representation of the changes themselves,
	and a pointer to the previous commit(s).
	In this way, Git creates a tree of commits that shows
	the evolution of a project over time.
</p>

<h2>How is Git different than other version control systems?</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system,
	which means that every developer's machine contains a complete copy of the repository;
	thus, the entire history of the codebase is always stored locally.
	This is in contrast to many older such sytems that only stored this information on one centralized server.
</p>

<h2>Let's get started!</h2>
<p>Now that you have a general idea of what Git is
	and what it can do, let's learn how to use it!
</p>
<p><u>Note:</u> it is good practice to keep your files for each
	lab/project/hw assignment in its own distinct subdirectory
	of the appropriate course directory.
	This is wise for both organizational and version control-related reasons,
	as you will see.
