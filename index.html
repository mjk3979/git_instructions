<h1>Introduction to Git</h1>

<h2>What is version control?</h2>
<p>Version control is used to keep track of the changes made on a set of files over time (commonly known as "revisions" or "commits").  This is useful for recovering from accidentally deleted or broken code and for collaborative coding in a team.  Git is a good example of a version control system.</p>

<h2>Why should I use it?</h2>
<!-- TODO: insert wisdom -->
<p>(Because we said so.)</p>

<h2>How does Git fit in?</h2>
<p>Each Git repository consists of a <code>.git</code> directory containing a representation of the version history.  This directory is usually located inside a working directory that contains the currently "checked-out" commit, as well as any unversioned changes that have been made.</p>
<p>Each "change" (or commit) consists of a user-entered message describing the changes that were made, a representation of the changes themselves, and a pointer to the previous version of each file.  In this way, Git creates something like a linked-list of commits that shows the evolution of a project over time.</p>

<h2>How is this different than other version control systems?</h2>
<!-- TODO: dumb down Sol's description of "distributed" whatever -->
<p>(It's better.)</p>

<h2>Let's get started!</h2>
<p>Now that you have a general idea of what Git is and what it can help you do, let's go over how to use it!</p>
<p><u>Note:</u> it is good practice to keep your files for each lab/project/hw assignment in its own distinct subdirectory of the appropriate course directory.  This is wise for both organizational and version control-related reasons, as you will see.</p>
